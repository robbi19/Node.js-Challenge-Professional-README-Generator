# Description

* When creating an open source project on GitHub, having a high-quality README is crucial. It should provide essential information about the application, such as its usage, installation instructions, issue reporting guidelines, and contribution guidelines. By including these details, other developers are more likely to utilize and contribute to the progress of the project.

*To expedite the process, a command line application can be built using 100% JSON and Node Package Manager (NPM), leveraging the package Inquirer. This application allows for the quick and easy generation of a project README.

*Once the user provides their input, the application will automatically generate the README file. This enables the project creator to spend more time on completing the project itself, while minimizing the time spent on crafting a comprehensive README.
